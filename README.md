Developing all day all time.

I know  a few things like 

      1. Console.writeLine("Here there I'm Alex Kekee Alias Isi Kekee");
      2. echo 'I have aften coded in php and I liked it!';
      3. INSERT INTO GithubProfile(FullName,Alias,ProgramingStack)
            VALUES (
                  'ALEX KEKEE',
                  '{"Kyalo-Kekee","Isi Kekee"}',
                  '{"C#", "PHP", "MYSQL","MSSQL","SQL","T-SQL"}
            )
       4. CTRL C + CTRL V on stackoverflow, Cheers!
